<h1>land here... hopefully safe!</h1>
<p>
	this site is made with the <em>director</em> typeface from ange degheest, as an homage to
	typewriter models. the typeface was specifically created to reflect the 'prestige and authority'
	of the Hermes typewriter models. though constricting, degheest crafted a contrasting design.. with
	gentle serifs and pleasant terminals. this site is made by mei (#justforfun) and i do hope you
	find pleasure here, very soon / my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/awhmaisy">@awhmaisy</a>
